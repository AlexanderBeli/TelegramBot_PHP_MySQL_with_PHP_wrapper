Getting to know how to use native php wrapper for [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#authorizing-your-bot).

Checked two biblioteques: first is [here](https://github.com/TelegramBot/Api) and second is [here](https://github.com/php-telegram-bot/core?tab=readme-ov-file).

This time I used the second one.
